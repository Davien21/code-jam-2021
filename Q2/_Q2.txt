Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2

 

Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 1000
    0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
